> *To whom it may concern that needs to access my encrypted USB, append "important.txt" to the end of the site main url for additional information. (e.g. site.github.io/important.txt, NOT site.github.io/subdirectory/important.txt) You will only be prompted to enter a password for the USB if using a linux system that uses the ext4 partition scheme. Using this drive with Windows will not work by default and will require an external ext4 reading software to access this drive. Formatting this device if prompted will result in the destruction of all the data in this drive.*
