![me](/static/img/me.png){:class="cover"}

My name is **Nicolas Perriault**, I live in southern France near Montpellier and am pretty much **enjoying my life**.

I'm a freelance [Web developer](/code/), self-employed by my own tiny company, [Akei](https://annuaire-entreprises.data.gouv.fr/entreprise/880760681). I'm specialized in [Elm](/tags/#elm), [Python](/tags/#python), [Django](/tags/#django), [JavaScript](/tags/#javascript) and am well-versed into [Open Source Software](https:/github.com/n1k0). **I work remotely exclusively.**

These days I'm mainly working with [beta.gouv](https://beta.gouv.fr/). Previously, I worked at cool companies like [Mozilla](https://mozilla.com/), [Sensiolabs](https://sensiolabs.com/fr/), [Clever-Age](https://www.clever-age.com/), [Scopyleft](http://scopyleft.fr/) and [Allo-Media](https://www.allo-media.net/).

I [speak](/talks/) at conferences, <del>sometimes</del> rarely now.

I also practice [photography](https://pixelfed.social/n1k0), [music](https://soundcloud.com/n1k0), and [rant (in French)](/carnet/) <del>a bit too much</del> rarely (nowadays I occasionally use [Mastodon](https://mamot.fr/@n1k0) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/n1k0) for that purpose).

The source code of this blog and most of its contents are [open sourced on Github](https://github.com/n1k0/nicolas.perriault.net).
