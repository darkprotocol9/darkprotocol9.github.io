This is **darkprotocol9**—the identity I'll be writing under in this blog. Think of it as my kind of home away from home. I’ve created different blogs in the past, often with the goal of typing out my feelings and thoughts—a mix of venting and life updates. This blog, in a way, will be like a public diary, open for anyone to read.

With my handle on Instagram is @darkprotocol9, and you may connect this blog to me. I’m immensely grateful for each person I’ve met, regardless of how our interactions unfolded. Each connection, good or bad, was a part of an intense and meaningful learning experience.

In the past, I struggled to maintain any specific blog, often because my situation improved, making me feel like I didn’t need to type out my feelings anymore. But this time, I hope things will be different. I’ve come to realize that remembering my past is essential to moving forward into my future. I want to look back later in life and understand where I came from, what thoughts I had, and what dreams I wanted to achieve.

I guess that’s what journaling is all about, but I don’t trust keeping this information stored locally. So, I’ve created this separate identity, along with an associated Gmail, GitHub, and Instagram account, so I can express myself freely. I hope this site will serve me well and perhaps provide value to the few (or random) readers who stumble upon it.

Over time, I've carved out many identities for the different groups of people who have entered my life. With **darkprotocol9**, I’ll strive to be as transparent as possible. 

Best of luck on this journey with me, but please be warned: some posts may discuss triggering topics.
