There are times where you want to talk about somthing but don't really have the courage, strength or willpower to do so. There are other times where you feel like all the courage in the world is eminating from the core of your being but you have to hold yourself back.

I have had this feeling and time and time again have put together various Github pages sites under the impression that I would finally write. This is yet another one of those sites and I really really wish to write here.

I am going to sync this repo with my backup devices. In case you do not know what I am referring to, I will talk about it soon in the more upcoming posts.
