There are times where you want to talk about somthing but don't really have the courage, strength or willpower to do so. There are other times where you feel like all the courage in the world is eminating from the core of your being but you have to hold yourself back.

I have had this feeling and time and time again have put together various Github pages sites under the impression that I would finally write. This is yet another one of those sites and I really really wish to write here.

I am going to sync this repo with my backup devices. In case you do not know what I am referring to, I will talk about it soon in the more upcoming posts.

Big changes are coming and I plan on moving out soon.

This site is going to be up until a potential breach of identity is identified.

Important to future USB holder: The key to access the SanDisk U3 Cruzer Micro 2GB USB is: "Und3ni@ble7!". All information in this USB is encrypted using LUKS version 2 with the ext4 partition scheme. The key to decrypt this drive is: "Und3ni@ble7!". This drive will contain sensitive information such as, accounts, sites, usernames of the drive owner/creator, and people associated to the person whose name the drive is named after. The privacy of the people must be respected. This is the only public location of key to access the drive.
